        "review": "Don't go for \"Exchange Value\" lolipop, its not worth it. The value for the exchanged phone given by amazon is undervalued, you can get a better deal on Cashify.com (only in selected city) and the amazon delivery guy who is also happened to be verification guy will also check your phone for any scratch or defect (like a jeweler) will reject upfront if he find any defect even a hairline and you will not get the New Phone as well even if you try to pay the balance amount. Then you have to re-order the phone once they canceled your current order. Its a hectic process for under valued exchange offer. Not sure what they expect from an old phone.",
